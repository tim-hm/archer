# Opinionated Arch Cli Installer

⚠ This doesn't work well ... yet! ⚠

## TODO

- [ ] better output than set -o ... could just do a progress bar with output into an
      install log?
- [ ] customisation script i.e., dotfiles (vimrc zshrc gitconfig)
- [ ] wireguard
- [ ] exa, bat
- [ ] dev: node, eslint, prettier
- [ ] oh-my-zsh prompts
- [ ] install stuff from aur: visual-studio-code-bin nerd-fonts-complete
- [ ] don't use gnome-extra (just cherry pick)

# Where is the installer!?

- `/run/archiso/bootmnt/installer`
