# Opinionated Arch Cli Installer

⚠ This doesn't work well ... yet! ⚠

## TODO

- [ ] better output than set -o ... could just do a progress bar with output into an
      install log?
- [ ] customisation script i.e., dotfiles (vimrc zshrc gitconfig, gnome keybindings) ... just call some user provided script?
- [ ] wireguard, kubectl, helm, wayland mapper, intellij, exa, bat
- [ ] dev: node, eslint, prettier
- [ ] oh-my-zsh prompts for input ... will installing from aur fix this? what about updates if its copied to your home folder?
- [ ] aur: visual-studio-code-bin nerd-fonts-complete (is cherry picking possible?)
- [ ] don't use gnome-extra (just cherry pick), shell extensions (gsconnect, horizontal spacing, argos, cpu freq, ...)

# Where is the installer!?

- `/run/archiso/bootmnt/installer`
